    "installation_instructions": "1) Input your engagement project id\n\n    Information on your project token can be found [here](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/project-settings-2)\n    \n    2) Input your engagement hostname. \n    \n    This is the domain of your Engagement admin interface - e.g. demo_project.exponea.com\n    \n    3) Input your engagement API hostname. This is available at project settings > api Base URL.\n    \n    Your Customer Success Manager will be happy to help you with you API Hostname.\n    \n    4) In Engagement, generate an API keypair for a private group. Turn these into a base 64 encoded token. An easy way to achieve this is to install nodejs, start the repl and run: \n    ```\n    console.log(Buffer.from('<paste_public_key_here>:<paste_private_key_here>').toString('base64')) \n    ```\n    put this value into the Engagement_token field\n    \n    For more details, please see documentation on authentication [here](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/reference/authentication)\n    \n    5) The final thing to do is to configure the fields you would like to display. This is configured in the Engagement_payload field as a JSON object in the form:\n    \n    ```\n    {\n    'fields' : [{\n      'type': 'segmentation attribute etc',\n      'id' : 'the internal Engagement id of the field',\n      'label' : 'How you would like the field labelled in your Zendesk sidebar'\n    },\n    {...another field...},\n    {...another field...}\n    ]}\n    ```\n    The JSON above is the exact JSON passed to the [customer attribute API call] - (https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/reference/customer-api-overview-1) extended with a 'label' field as a friendly display name within Zendesk.\n    \n    Field ID's can be ascertained by looking at the URL within Engagement when accessing the field in question.\n    \n    ",
