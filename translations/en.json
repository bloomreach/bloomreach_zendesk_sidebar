    "installation_instructions": "1) Input your engagement project id - this can be found in the project settings > project_token area of your Engagement project.
      2) Input your engagement hostname. This is the domain of your Engagement admin interface - e.g. demo_project.exponea.com  
      3) Input your engagement API hostname. This is available at project settings > api Base URL.
      4) In Engagement, generate an API keypair for a private group. Turn these into a base 64 encoded token. An easy way to achieve this is to install nodejs, start the repl and paste: console.log(Buffer.from('<public_key>:<private_key>').toString("base64")) - put this value into the Engagement_token field
      5) The final thing to do is to configure the fields you would like to display. This is configured in the Engagement_payload field as a JSON object in the form:
      
      {
        'fields' : [
        {
          'type': segmentation, attribute etc,
          'id' : the internal Engagement id of the field
          'label' : what you want the name to be when display inside Zendesk
        },
        {...},
        {...}
        ]
      } 
      
      The exact values you require can be found by referring to the Bloomreach Engagement API Reference [here](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/reference/welcome)"
