    ## Zendesk Integration
    
    Access information stored in our Single View of the Customer from within the sidebar of a Zendesk ticket:
    
     - **Aggregates:** customer attributes that are calculated from already existing data.
     - **Expressions:** Formula that serves as a derived attribute.
     - **Properties:** Data stored about a customer
     - **Predictions:** Ranking your customer with a different degree of probability to complete certain actions (e.g. purchase, visit, churn). Derive insights from the past, present to predicted future behavior.
     - **Segmentations:** These allow you to group **customers** on the basis of their attributes and activities, and help you to understand how these groups differ from each other.
     - **Recommendations:** We offer a wide selection of product recommendation models, enabling you to select from over 12 out‑of‑the‑box recommendation templates ready to be deployed on your website, emails or other available channels. For advanced users, we offer the possibility to create a custom recommendation model based on your specific business needs.
     - **Consents:** manage your subscription policies and tracks any changes to consents for every customer.

    "installation_instructions" : "1) Input your engagement project id

    Information on your project token can be found [here](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/project-settings-2)
    
    2) Input your engagement hostname. 
    
    This is the domain of your Engagement admin interface - e.g. demo_project.exponea.com
    
    3) Input your engagement API hostname. This is available at project settings > api Base URL.
    
    Your Customer Success Manager will be happy to help you with you API Hostname.
    
    4) In Engagement, generate an API keypair for a private group. Turn these into a base 64 encoded token. An easy way to achieve this is to install nodejs, start the repl and run: 
    ```
    console.log(Buffer.from('<paste_public_key_here>:<paste_private_key_here>').toString("base64")) 
    ```
    put this value into the Engagement_token field
    
    For more details, please see documentation on authentication [here](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/reference/authentication)
    
    5) The final thing to do is to configure the fields you would like to display. This is configured in the Engagement_payload field as a JSON object in the form:
    
    ```
    {
    "fields" : [{
      "type": "segmentation attribute etc",
      "id" : "the internal Engagement id of the field",
      "label" : "How you would like the field labelled in your Zendesk sidebar"
    },
    {...another field...},
    {...another field...}
    ]}
    ```
    The JSON above is the exact JSON passed to the [customer attribute API call] - (https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/reference/customer-api-overview-1) extended with a 'label' field as a friendly display name within Zendesk.
    
    Field ID's can be ascertained by looking at the URL within Engagement when accessing the field in question.

    "parameters": {
      "ENGAGEMENT_PROJECT" : {"label" : "Engagement Project Id", "helpText" : "The Id Of you Engagement Project, found on the settings page."},

      "ENGAGEMENT_TOKEN" : {"label" : "Engagement Token", "helpText" : "Base 64 encoding of your public and private Engagement project keys. Most easily generated using nodejs with the following command from the REPL: console.log(Buffer.from('<public_key>:<private_key>').toString('base64'))"},
